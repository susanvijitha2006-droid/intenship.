1️⃣ Selected Public API:
Used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch 5-day weather forecast data for Delhi.

2️⃣ Fetched Data:
Used the requests library to send an HTTP request to the API endpoint, retrieving data in JSON format.

3️⃣ Parsed Data:
Extracted:

Date and Time

Temperature (°C)

Humidity (%)
from the JSON response and stored them into Python lists.

4️⃣ Created DataFrame:
Used pandas to structure the extracted data into a clean, organized DataFrame for easier handling and visualization.

5️⃣ Visualization:
Used:

matplotlib for figure handling.

seaborn for aesthetic line plots.

Created a line plot showing:

Temperature trends across the 5-day forecast.

Humidity trends across the same period.

This helped visualize weather changes over time clearly and intuitively.
